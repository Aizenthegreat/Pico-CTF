The steps i took were the following 

1. launch the website and inspect the code. (ctrl + shift + c)


2. To get more information on what to look for i clicked the hint.
Hint: check how the password is checked
Inspected the javascript code whos function handles the password check 



3. Based on the screenshot and the hint the solution will remain in the function string and its conditions for what passes and what fails. 
Which I assume is the inside the if statement. If a string of characters is greater than or equal to 48 && if a string of characters less than or equal to 57. 
I also assume the first condition is for the username and the second is the password.



4. Let me experiment, I entered a username that has a greater than or equal to string count of 48 and a password string count of less than or equal to 57
Login failed.
After a deeper look, it looks like the fuction creates a hash and then compares the hash created from the users input and compares it to the adminForHash.value
I can take the value and reverse engineer the value to find the actual username:password. 
The value is a MD5 hash: 2196812e91c29df34f5e217cfd639881



5.  After decrypting the hash its revealed to just be "successfullogin"



   After some more inspection, I noticed that there is a hyperlink in the javascript code "secure.js". After clicking on it, I see there is a new function.


6. Clearly it gives me the username and password. After putting those into the login prompt
I get the CTF
